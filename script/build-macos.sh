  # On the GitHub Actions macOS runners the curl-config command resolves to
  # a homebrew-installed version of curl which ends up providing us with a
  # library search path (-L/usr/local/Cellar/curl/7.74.0/lib) instead of
  # simply `-lcurl`. This causes problems when the git binaries are used on
  # systems that don't have the homebrew version of curl. We want to use the
  # system-provided curl.
  #
  # Specifically we saw this be a problem when the git-remote-https binary
  # was signed during the bundling process of GitHub Desktop and attempts to
  # execute it would trigger the following error
  #
  # dyld: Library not loaded: /usr/local/opt/curl/lib/libcurl.4.dylib
  # Referenced from: /Applications/GitHub Desktop.app/[...]/git-remote-https
  # Reason: image not found
  #
  # For this reason we set CURL_CONFIG to the system version explicitly here.
  #
  # HACK: There is no way of adding additional CFLAGS without running the
  # configure script. However the Makefile prepends some developer CFLAGS that
  # we could use to select the right target CPU to cross-compile git.
